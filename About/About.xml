[b]Development stopped.[/b]
[i]I&apos;ve ceased all my modding activities, due to lack of free time and new found hobbies. 
Please enjoy this mod while it&apos;s still working with RW 1.0, but don&apos;t expect any updates or fixes.[/i]

More options for the Colonist Bar.
- Allows custom sorting as well as custom scaling.
- All options available with Right Mouse Button click on any icon.
- FollowMe™ functionality via Middle Mouse Button click.

Includes icon stats based on &apos;Pawn State Icons™&apos; by Dan Sadler
Includes &apos;FollowMe™&apos; functionality by Fluffy with updated code by alexschrod
Includes &apos;ZoomToMouse™&apos; functionality by Fluffy

To access the new options menu + sorting, right mouse click on any colonist icon.

[h1]Mood bar explaination[/h1] 
The mood bar is calculated for each colonist individually. Each time you have a minor break risk, the first blue bar is depleted, then you have a full yellow bar that will become a major break risk if depleted. So each break risk color is just a tiny bit of the vanilla mood.

[h1]Supported languages[/h1] 
Chinese (simplified and traditional) – thx to duduluu
English
French – thx to Gorgious
German
Russian – thx to skyarkhangel (taken from HardCore SK)
