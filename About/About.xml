[b]Development stopped.[/b]
[i]I've ceased all my modding activities, due to lack of free time and new found hobbies. 
Please enjoy this mod while it's still working with RW 1.0, but don't expect any updates or fixes.[/i]

More options for the Colonist Bar.
- Allows custom sorting as well as custom scaling.
- All options available with Right Mouse Button click on any icon.
- FollowMe™ functionality via Middle Mouse Button click.

Includes icon stats based on 'Pawn State Icons™' by Dan Sadler
Includes 'FollowMe™' functionality by Fluffy with updated code by alexschrod
Includes 'ZoomToMouse™' functionality by Fluffy

To access the new options menu + sorting, right mouse click on any colonist icon.

[h1]Mood bar explaination[/h1] 
The mood bar is calculated for each colonist individually. Each time you have a minor break risk, the first blue bar is depleted, then you have a full yellow bar that will become a major break risk if depleted. So each break risk color is just a tiny bit of the vanilla mood.
