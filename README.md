# Mood bar explaination
 
The mood bar is calculated for each colonist individually. Each time you have a minor break risk, the first blue bar is depleted, then you have a full yellow bar that will become a major break risk if depleted. So each break risk color is just a tiny bit of the vanilla mood.
